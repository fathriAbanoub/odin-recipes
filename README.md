# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The "Odin Recipes" project aims to create a simple recipe website using basic HTML.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to practice the fundamentals of HTML by building a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will link to a few different recipes. Each recipe will have its own page, showcasing its name, ingredients, and preparation steps.

## Features

- A homepage with links to individual recipe pages.
- Each recipe page includes:
  - Recipe title
  - List of ingredients
  - Steps for preparation

## Technologies Used

- HTML

## Getting Started

To view the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Future Improvements

- Add CSS for styling to make the website more visually appealing.
- Implement JavaScript to enhance interactivity.
- Expand the number of recipes and categories.
